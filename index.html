      <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
      <p>Hi, everyone! I'm Joyce, I was born on November 25,2004, in Bandung.<br>
        I'm currently 18 years old and I am a second-year student majoring in Informatics Engineering, studying HTML in my third semester at Indonesia Adventist University (UNAI).<br>
        So, I love chemistry by the way, but for some reason, I ended up pursuing a major that isn't related to it. However, I will do my best to continue enjoying my current field of study!<br>
        Oh yea, I enjoy reading manga and watching anime. My anime husbu/crush was <u>Kageyama Tobio</u> from Haikyuu. But for now, my anime husbu/crush is <u>Roronoa Zoro</u>.<br>
        He's as green as the color of FTI :D <br></p>
